# Honor Help (tutors.concordiashanghai.org) The National Honor Society/National Science Honor Society Website

<p>
This is primarily a tutoring and service management system on a website using php, mysql, javascript, html and css. This is my second major website project.
<br>
This system allows NHS/SNHS members to set their availability times in advance and students to sign up for tutoring to dates that are convenient for them. 
<br>
This website is also used to organize and store student service hours and project information. (Project in this definition means anything that helps yield service hours for students)

<h3>When several members log in their times, the calendar will fill up. Requestors can log in on their account and choose a field/subject, then select tutors from their side. </h3>
